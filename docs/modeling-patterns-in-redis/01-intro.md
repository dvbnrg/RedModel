# Intro

    - How do I structure my Data?
        - Is my application read heavy, or write heavy?
        - What does the user experience look like?
        - How does your data need to be presented to the user?
        - How much data will you be storing?
        - What performance considerations do you need to account for?
        - How do you anticipate scaling your application?

    - SQL vs NoSQL
        - SQL is a structured query language
        - NoSQL can mean different things:
            - Data modeling for NoSQL vs SQL is obviously different
            - There are also differencees in terms of scalability, with NoSQL being easier to scale horizontally

    - Object Oriented Design
        - Usually using Javascript, Java, C#
        - Data is represented as strings, lists, sets, hashes, JSON, etc.
        - Using SQL or document database, data wrangling into multiple tables and collections is required
        - As a result, queries become more complicated
            - This is called impedence mismatch and is why NoSQL exists
        - Large applications might use other database systems such as neo4j for graph data, mongoDB for document data, influxDB for time series
            - Using separate databases turns impedence mismatch into a database orchestration problem
        - You have to juggle multiple connections to different databases, as well as learn the client libraries used
        - With Redis you get:
            - strings
            - lists
            - sets
            - hashes
            - JSON
            - Search
            - Graph
            - Time Series
            - Bloom
        - This reduces impedence mismatch
            - you can use a single connection or a connection pool and client library
            - this way you end up with a simplified architecture with purpose built models that are blazing fast and simple to manage
        - NoSQL is more than just about document stores
        - Data Modeling in SQL is typically focused on relationships
            - SQL is meant for set based operations on relational data
            - NoSQL doesn't have this constraint and is much more flexible in the way you model data
                - This can also lead to schemas being overly complex
                - When designing your schema, be mindful of performance and try to keep things simple
