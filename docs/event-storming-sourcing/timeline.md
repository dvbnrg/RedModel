# Timeline

    - Timeline or sequence of events
    - A timeline of domain events is the critical output of the first step in the event-storming process. 
    - The timeline gives everyone a common understanding of when events take place in relation to each other. 
    - You still need to take this initial level of understanding and move it toward an implementation. 
    - In making that step, expand your thinking to encompass the idea of a command, which is the action that starts the processing that triggers an event. 
    - As part of understanding the role of the command, you want to know who starts a command (actors) and what information is needed to allow the command to run. 
    - This diagram shows how those analysis elements are linked together:
