# Reactions

    - Policies are reactive logic that takes place after an event occurs. 
        - In this example, policies are indicated by light purple sticky notes. 
        - A policy triggers other commands. Policies always start with the phrase "whenever...". 
        - Policies can be a manual step that a human follows, such as a documented procedure or guidance, or they can be automated. 
        - When you apply the Agile Business Rule Development methodology, policies are mapped to decisions within the Decision Model Notation.
